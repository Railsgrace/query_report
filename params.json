Because all we need to\r\nconcentrate in a report is the query and filter.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nQuery report is tested with Rails 3. You can add it to your Gemfile with:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'query_report'\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the bundle command to install it.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample controller which uses query report.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n\r\n    require 'query_report/helper'  #need to require the helper\r\n\r\n    class InvoicesController < ApplicationController\r\n      include QueryReport::Helper  #need to include it\r\n\r\n      def index\r\n        @invoices = Invoice.scoped\r\n\r\n        reporter(@invoices) do\r\n          filter :title, type: :text\r\n          filter :created_at, type: :date, default: [5.months.ago.to_date.to_s(:db), 1.months.from_now.to_date.to_s(:db)]\r\n          filter :paid, type: :boolean, default: false\r\n\r\n          column :title do |invoice|\r\n            link_to invoice.title, invoice\r\n          end\r\n          column :total_paid\r\n          column :total_charged\r\n          column :paid\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\nMIT License.
