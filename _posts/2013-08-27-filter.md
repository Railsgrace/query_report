## Basic

By default query report supports 3 type of filters
1. text (using ransack equality filter)
2. boolean (provides a drop down of ''/yes/no choices)
3. date (a date between filter with ransack gteq and lteq)

```ruby
reporter(User.scoped) do
    filter :name, type: :text
    filter :created_at, type: :date
    filter :married, type: :boolean
    column :name
	column :age
end
```

By default query report generates the date input with the HTML 5 date type.
But you can change any of the filter to look the way you want.

## Custom filter with supported types

If you want to customize the filter and write your own query to do so, then you can do it as follows,

```ruby
reporter(User.scoped) do
    #supporting text filter
    filter :name, type: :text do |query, name|
        query.where("name like ?", "%#{name}%")
    end
    #supporting date filter
    filter :created_at, type: :date do |query, from, to|
        query.where("created_at >= ? and created_at =< ?",
                     from.to_date.beginning_of_day, to.to_date.end_of_day)
    end
    #supporting boolean filter
    filter :married, type: :boolean do |query, married|
        query.where(married: married)
    end

    column :name
	column :age
end
```
